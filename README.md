## What is CodePilot?

**CodePilot** silently watches your coding activity, classifies your commits using Google Gemini AI, groups related work into logical tasks, and turns everything into professional reports - daily summaries, weekly logs, and appraisal documents without any manual effort.

## Features

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live Activity Tracking**   | Tracks edits and focus events in real time across all Git repos                              |
| **AI Commit Classification** | Classifies commits as `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, or `chore` via Gemini |
| **Smart Work Unit Grouping** | Clusters related commits into named logical tasks automatically                              |
| **Report Generator**         | Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Appraisal reports with AI-written narratives                      |
| **Natural Language Q&A**     | Ask questions like _"What did I work on this week?"_ directly in VS Code                     |
| **Multi-Repo Support**       | Tracks all workspace folders and additional configured repo paths simultaneously             |
| **Risk Detector**            | Warns when uncommitted changes grow large or stale                                           |
| **GitHub Sync**              | Optionally pushes structured logs to a centralized `codepilot-logs` GitHub repo              |
| **Secure Credentials**       | GitHub PAT and Gemini API key stored in VS Code Secret Storage — never in plaintext          |

## Installation

### From VSIX (Current)

1. Download the `.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Rahulnisanth/CodePilot/releases)
2. In VS Code: `Cmd+Shift+P` → **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**
3. Select the file and reload

### Requirements

- VS Code `^1.96.0`
- A Git repository open in your workspace

---

## Quick Setup

### 1. Add GitHub Credentials _(for sync)_

Run any sync action (`CodePilot: Sync to GitHub Now`) and you'll be prompted for:

- Your **GitHub username**
- A **GitHub PAT** with `repo` scope → [create one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

Credentials are stored securely in VS Code Secret Storage.

### 2. Add Gemini API Key _(for AI features)_

Run any AI feature (e.g. generate a report) and you'll be prompted for a Gemini key → [get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

> Without a Gemini key, CodePilot still works — commit classification falls back to keyword matching and reports are generated without AI narratives.

## Reports

Reports are saved to `~/.codePilot/reports/` and opened automatically after generation.

**Each report includes:**

- AI-generated achievement highlights (2–3 sentences, Gemini powered)
- Total active coding time and daily breakdown
- Work units with type labels and commit counts
- Repository breakdown (time + commits per repo)
- Top 10 most edited files
- Risk flags for the period

**Appraisal example:**

```text
Cmd+Shift+P → CodePilot: Generate Appraisal Report
Start date: 2026-01-01
End date:   2026-03-31
```

## Privacy & Security

- **Source code** — never transmitted anywhere
- **Commit messages + diff stats** — sent to Gemini API for classification (opt-in via key)
- **GitHub PAT + Gemini key** — stored in VS Code Secret Storage only
- **Activity logs** — stored locally at `~/.codePilot/`, optionally synced to GitHub if enabled
